# ApplicationIntlContext

The ApplicationIntContext defines an interface for access to the framework's i18n APIs.
Please see the [How to Use Translated Strings](/components/terra-application/application/how-to/use-translated-strings) page for usage examples.

## Context Value

The value of the ApplicationIntlContext is an object containing i18n APIs.
Please review the IntlShape as defined by [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/API.md#intlshape).

The `intlShape` value can be imported from `react-intl` as needed for prop validation.

```js
import { intlShape } from 'react-intl';
```
