# How To Change the Application Theme

The theme used by the application is set using the `themeName` prop on ApplicationBase.

> Note: Please review the [theme aggregation documentation](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit/tree/master/scripts/aggregate-themes#theme-aggregation) to ensure the proper configuration is in place for themeable applications.

```diff
  import React from 'react';
+ import CernerClinicalTheme from 'cerner-clinical-theme/scoped-theme';

  import ApplicationBase from 'terra-application/lib/application-base';

  const ExampleApp = () => (
    <ApplicationBase
      locale="en-us"
+     themeIsGlobal
+     themeName={CernerClinicalTheme.themeName}
    >
      {...}
    </ApplicationBase>
  );

  export default ExampleApp;
```
